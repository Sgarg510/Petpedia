	  <p>The cat, often referred to as the domestic cat to distinguish from other felids and felines, is a small and typically furry, carnivorous mammal. It is often called house cat when kept as indoor pet or feral/feral domestic cat when wild. It is often valued by humans for companionship and for its ability to hunt vermin</p>
	  <p>There's lots you can do within in the first day to ease your new kitten / cat adoption into your home. When you arrive, select a quiet, closed-in area such as your bedroom or a small room away from the main foot traffic, and set it up with a litter box, bed, food and water. If you are adopting an adult cat, be sure that this "starter room" has locked screens, or keep the windows completely closed. If feasible, make the starter room the permanent location of the litter box. If you plan on having the permanent location of the litter box be elsewhere, you'll need two litter boxes. Please do consider the advantages of keeping your new cat indoors always â€” outdoor cats are exposed to disease, cat fights, being killed by dogs and other wild animals, and hit by cars. If you have other pets, don't introduce the new pet immediately.<br>
